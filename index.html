                <fixed><kbd>Space</kbd> to skip</fixed>
                <p>''I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international 
                    level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish. I mean 
                    with artificial intelligence we're summoning the demon 
                    (Elon Musk: Artificial intelligence is our biggest existential threat).''
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) seems like a scary thought, but one question 
                    arises what is artificial intelligence? AI is the study intelligent 
                    software and machines that have human like characteristics such as 
                    reasoning, learning, problem-solving, predicting, planning and the use of language 
                    and vision (Welcome to Waterloo.AI). AI is everywhere around us, ranging from the automotive industry, 
                    healthcare, finance sector, manufacturing, and everyday tasks. One big advancement in the field of 
                    AI and human computer interaction is the Metaverse. The metaverse is basically a digital world. 
                    It allows users to interact with many different technologies, such as virtual reality in a digital universe. 
                    This paper will highlight how the affordances such as appearance of realness, embodiment, usability in 
                    artificial intelligence (AI) specifically in the metaverse negatively affect mental and physical health (Tran et al.).</p>

                <h2 class="sub_title"><span>./Escapism</span></h2>

                <ul>
                    <p>One of the major affordances in using virtual reality (VR) in the metaverse is appearance of realness 
                        and how it can help someone escape the real world. As mentioned in Han et al, escapism is when someone 
                        has problems to deal with but chooses to perform other self-destructive tasks. An individual can use the 
                        metaverse as a way to escape the real world (Han et al.). The ability to have real experiences within the 
                        metaverse further promotes this idea. Self-indulgent escapism can have many side effects including depression, 
                        anxiety, and increased aggression. Furthermore, individuals will become addicted to the metaverse as they find 
                        it as a way to escape real life, causing an addiction and lower self-control (Han et al.). Other than ruining one's 
                        mental health it causes social anxiety as people will have less interactions within the real world and feel more 
                        lonely. This will further deteriorate someone's mental health and a cycle arises causing their real-life struggles 
                        to increase. Therefore, the idea of having the metaverse be real to an extent where users can use it as an escape from 
                        the real world can cause mental health to deteriorate as it becomes an addiction.</p>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="sub_title"><span>./Bullying and Harassment</span></h2>
                <ul>
                    <p>One huge problem that comes with most social media platforms is bullying, and with the metaverse this problem will become even bigger and even worse (Frenkel and Browning). 
                    When people detach from their real selves, they tend to feel like that they can do anything as they are protected by a screen or in the case of the metaverse they are protected by an avatar. 
                    This has been seen in a lot in many social media platforms and a survey done by the European commissionâ€™s joint research centre found that about 50% of children have experienced cyberbullying at 
                    least once (Enough is enough: Cyberbullying). Safety is a problem within the metaverse, and this seen in many of the VR games now which contain forms of harassment, assault, and bullying. This can become 
                    worse than social media platforms as people will be in a fully digital environment and basically be able to do anything that is done in the real world and even worse as they will think that they 
                    can easily get away with it. Moreover, One of Meta's executives, Andrew Bosworth, wrote that ''at any meaningful scale is practically impossible,'' he is mentioning how it is very hard to keep up 
                    with safety in the metaverse as it is at a very large scale. This is really concerning as even one of the biggest companies that are pushing the metaverse out into the world are unable to control 
                    safety within it. This is especially concerning for children as they will also be using the metaverse and it really hard to keep track of what people are doing. These bullying and harassment 
                    incidents can cause users to get traumatized which will affect their mental health.</p>

                <fixed><kbd>Space</kbd> to skip</fixed>

                <h2 class="sub_title"><span>./Usability of The Metaverse</span></h2>
                <ul>
                    <p>The usability of the metaverse is very broad which can worsen physical health. It becomes very difficult to exercise as the usability of the metaverse is very wide and people can opt out to 
                        do activities that usually require physicality without much movement. This causes the physical health of users to deteriorate. Furthermore, some people get their physical exercise by just 
                        walking to work for example, but one thing that some corporations are trying to deploy on the metaverse is online offices, so this will further worsen physical health. This has been seen 
                        in devices such as Wii Sports where a user can play sports with their friends without having to do much physical exercise. In conclusion, the metaverse will eventually deteriorate the user's 
                        physical health if it is not used in moderation.</p>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="sub_title"><span>./Embodiment</span></h2>
                <ul>
                    <p>Embodiment also plays a big role, us as humans always want to picture the better version of ourselves, and that is what we like to post on social media specifically Instagram. We choose 
                        to show the parts of our lives that we like and hide everything else. With the metaverse we will get the opportunity to make ourselves look however we want. This forces us to live a life 
                        that is not close to our real life which is very unhealthy (Relojo-Howell). The metaverse will allow people to reach their perfect form easily which can in turn reduce physical health as people 
                        will settle for their online identity. Also, always being in the metaverse or spending long periods of time in it throughout will cause mental exhaustion. With the constant stimulation through 
                        strong lights and engaging visuals people will have a tough time recovering once their back in the real-world from this exhaustion which further affects their physical health as this will cause 
                        a constant feeling of being tired.</p>

                <h2 class="sub_title"><span>./The connection between the Matrix and the Metaverse</span></h2>
                <ul>
                    <p>The Matrix really played a big role in showing the dangers of technological advancement.''Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. Fate, it seems, is not without a 
                        sense of irony. (Wachowski, Lana, and Lilly Wachowski)'' In the movie The Matrix (1999), it can be seen that the line between humans and machines is becoming thinner and thinner. This is following 
                        the trend on earth at the moment. With the advancement of technology many people have become so dependent on technology that without it they will have a tough time functioning, and therefore affecting 
                        our mental and physical health. In the Matrix AI took over the world and harvest humans as a source of energy to power themselves, the technology has become smarter than the humans. With the metaverse, 
                        it is a very similar situation where the technology will take over our minds just like all the video games around us and basically harvest our brains. The Matrix has many similarities to the metaverse 
                        where we are all in a digital world, this can also be seen in movies such as ready player one. The lesson learned from the matrix is that we should be careful with technology and that it can be very dangerous, 
                        and in my opinion, we should be really careful with the metaverse as it can have bad side effects.</p>

                <h2 class="sub_title"><span>./Conclusion</span></h2>
                <ul>
                    <p>In conclusion, the Metaverse can have many effects on our mental and physical health on us as humans. First off, escapism, bullying and harassment are big problems within the metaverse community that causes a downward spiral on 
                        one's mental health. Secondly, the usability of the Metaverse and embodiment causes deterioration in the user's physical health. After watching the Metaverse in class I was able to connect all of this as within the movie one 
                        big theme was that it was trying to warn us from technology takeover which is happening through the Metaverse. 
                        To conclude it can be seen that affordances such as appearance of realness, embodiment, usability in the metaverse negatively affect mental and physical health.</p>
